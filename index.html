                    <h2> Graduation Project | 2024</h2>
                    <p>SquatCommute was my graduation project, developed to encourage healthier and more sustainable commuting habits. The project involved creating a motion-tracking device that uses a camera to recognize and count squat movements in real time. 
                        Built using Python, and tools like OpenCV, Mediapipe, tkinter, and Numpy. For data handling, we used SQLite database.
                         The system accurately identifies squats through posture detection and body movement analysis. Each completed squat rewards users with points that can be redeemed for discounted public transport tickets, 
                        linking fitness with sustainable mobility.
